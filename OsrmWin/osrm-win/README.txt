1. Put OSM data (*.osm.pbf or *.osm) to data sub-folder. There is already a nanjing.osm as example.
2. Run Extract.bat which generates various data files in data sub-folder.
3. Run Server.bat which starts bin\osrm-routed.exe as a backend web server and a browser page for
   webclient.
4. You can try the routing function on the browser page.
